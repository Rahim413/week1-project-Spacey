# week1-project-Spacey
## Achievements
The Spacey X website was successfully developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring three main sections.
### Navigation Bar:
The navigation bar includes links to different sections of the site. Smooth scrolling and hover effects were implemented for all internal links, allowing seamless navigation across the page.
### Main Sections:
Background images, flexbox, and a responsive layout were used to create visually appealing content sections. A "back to top" button was added, enabling users to quickly return to the top of the page.
### Footer:
A basic footer was created, featuring social media icons that link to external social media sites.
Background Audio:
Background music plays automatically when users interact with the website, adding to the immersive experience.
## Challenges
1. Footer Styling
Achieving consistent footer styling across various screen sizes was challenging, particularly in aligning it with the background image.
2. Autoplay Background Music
Implementing autoplay for background music was difficult due to browser restrictions. A JavaScript solution was used to ensure the music plays after the user interacts with the website.
## Future Enhancements
Advanced Footer Features: Plan to enhance the footer with additional content and features.
Music Controls: Implement user controls for the background music.
